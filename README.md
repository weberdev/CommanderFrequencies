# CommanderFrequencies
I got bored after class and wanted to see who the most averagely picked commanders were. This is the beginning of that.
Things of note: The list of commander decks was taken from EDHRec on November 10, 2023. It is likely to be out of date as I type this, on November 10, 2023. It is unlikely that the median point will vary too much, but your mileage may vary.
The next step is to continually query the EDHRec API and get the commanders of median popularity every day or so. This is a low priority because I want to go have dinner right now, and will handle this in a few weeks when I have less schoolwork.
